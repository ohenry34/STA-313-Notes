One of the best ways to get a handle on how the grammar works is to apply it to the analysis of existing graphics.
For each of the graphics listed below, write down the components of the graphic.
Don’t worry if you don’t know what the corresponding functions in ggplot2 are called (or if they even exist!),
instead focussing on recording the key elements of a plot so you could communicate it to someone else.
